# fault_detection

# Problem
Two images, good.png, and bad.png. The good.png file is an image of a metallic part without any defects and bad.png is a sample bad part. The problem is to build algorithm that can differentiate b/w good and bad part and output should tell where the defect is located.

# Analysis
The OpenCV() is used for comparing both the images and detecting the faulty area in the image.
